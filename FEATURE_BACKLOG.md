# Feature Backlog

## Upcoming Features to Implement

### 1. Shot-Level Performance Tracking
**Technique**: Real-time shot logging with type classification (smash, drop, clear, drive, net shot)
**Description**: Track shot types, success rate, placement accuracy, and distribution patterns during matches/drills. Include heat maps showing shot placement on court diagram. Store shot data with timestamps for analysis.

### 2. Video Analysis & Technique Library
**Technique**: Video upload with frame-by-frame analysis, side-by-side comparison
**Description**: Upload practice videos, compare with professional demonstrations, AI-powered posture analysis highlighting key form points (elbow position, wrist snap, footwork). Library of professional techniques organized by skill level.

### 3. Advanced Match Analytics
**Technique**: Statistical analysis with data visualization
**Description**: Rally length analysis, point conversion rate, service effectiveness, opponent pattern recognition. Generate insights like "You win 75% of rallies when starting with a low serve" or "Opponent struggles with backhand corners".

### 4. Technique Skill Tree
**Technique**: Progressive skill unlocking system with mastery paths
**Description**: Visual skill tree showing prerequisite techniques (e.g., must master basic clear before learning jump smash). Each technique has quality scoring based on form checkpoints. Unlock advanced techniques by achieving mastery in fundamentals.

### 5. Goal-Specific Plan Builder
**Technique**: Wizard-based plan generation with adaptive adjustments
**Description**: Answer questions about goals (tournament prep, fitness, skill development), current level, available time. AI generates customized plan with weekly breakdown. Plans adapt based on completion rates and performance trends.

### 6. Training Load Monitoring
**Technique**: Load calculation using volume × intensity metrics
**Description**: Track acute vs chronic workload ratio, prevent overtraining with automated warnings. Monitor recovery status with readiness scores. Visualize training load trends with recommended adjustments.

### 7. Opponent Intelligence System
**Technique**: Historical match data analysis with pattern recognition
**Description**: Create opponent profiles tracking their strengths, weaknesses, preferred shots, and patterns. Get pre-match strategy suggestions based on historical data. Post-match comparison of planned vs actual execution.

### 8. Technique Form Quality Scoring
**Technique**: Checklist-based assessment with video annotation
**Description**: Each technique has form checkpoints (e.g., footwork, grip, follow-through). Score each checkpoint 1-10, track improvement over time. Video annotations highlight correct/incorrect form elements.

### 9. Training Partner Matching
**Technique**: Skill-based matching algorithm with scheduling
**Description**: Find training partners with similar skill levels or complementary goals. Schedule shared training sessions. Track partner workout completion and provide collaborative challenges.

### 10. Competition Preparation Plans
**Technique**: Reverse periodization from competition date
**Description**: Input competition date, system calculates optimal training phases working backward. Includes taper strategy, peak timing, and mental preparation exercises. Pre-competition checklist and day-of routine builder.
